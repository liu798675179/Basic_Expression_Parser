=========

This is a simple ( median bits) infix turn suffix and evaluated program.

Rules: From left to right traverse each suffix numbers and symbols expressions, if digital outputs that become part of the postfix expression ; if the symbol, and the top of the stack to determine the priority of its symbols , is a right parenthesis or priority find the top level is less than symbol ( addition and subtraction , multiplication and division take precedence ) turn out to find the top element and output , and the current symbol into the stack until the final output postfix expression so far.

Postfix expression evaluation value calculation problem : stack -> stack conversion, coding differences in figures for the total more than 48 , so had to subtract 48 ......
